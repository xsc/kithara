;; ## Constructor

(defn ^{:added "0.1.2"} batching-consumer
  "Generate a consumer component based on the given batch processing function.

   - `:batch-size`: the maximum size of a single batch,
   - `:interval-ms`: the maximum time between the processing of two batches,
   - `:offer-timeout-ms`: the maximum waiting time for a spot in the queue,
   - `:queue-size`: the capacity of the internal `BlockingQueue`.

   All [[consumer]] options are allowed as well.

   The batch processing function gets a seq of messages and produces either:

   - a single confirmation map for all messages, or
   - a seq of in-order confirmation maps for each individual message.

   If less confirmations are returned than messages were given, `nil` will be
   used for the remaining ones, triggering the default confirmation handling of
   the consumer."
