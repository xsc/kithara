     :auto-delete? true}
    (if (string? value)
      {:queue-name value}
      value)))

;; ## Wrapper

(defn with-dead-letter-backoff
  "Wrap the given component(s) with setup of dead letter queues and exchanges.
   The following options can be given:

   - `:queue`: options for the dead letter queue (including `:queue-name`,
     `:durable?`, `:exclusive?` and `:auto-delete?`),
   - `:backoff-exchange`: options for the exchange the dead letter queue will be
     bound to (including `:exchange-name`, `:durable?`, `:exclusive?` and
     `:auto-delete?`),
   - `:retry-exchange`: options for the exchange that messages-to-retry will
     be published to (see `:backoff-exchange` for options),
   - `:backoff`: a map of `:min` and `:max` giving minimal and maximal backoff
     intervals in milliseconds (default: 50ms <= backoff <= 1m).

   All three values can be strings, in which case they will be used for
   queue/exchange names and result in a non-durable setup. If no names
   are given, they will be derived from the consumer queue's. Example:

   ```
   (defonce rabbitmq-consumer
     (-> ...
         (with-dead-letter-backoff
           {:queue            \"dead-letters\"
            :backoff-exchange \"dead-letters-backoff\"
            :retry-exchange   \"dead-letters-retry\"})
         (kithara.core/with-queue
           \"consumer-queue\"
           ...)
         ...))
   ```

   __Topology__

   The following is a minimal example, auto-generating names for
   exchanges/queues:

   ```
   (require '[kithara.core :as kithara])

   (defonce rabbitmq-consumer
     (-> (kithara/consumer ...)
         (with-dead-letter-backoff)
         (kithara/with-queue
           \"consumer-queue\"
           {:exchange \"consumer-exchange\", :routing-keys [\"#\"]})
         (kithara/with-channel)
         (kithara/with-connection)))
   ```

   This will create/expect the following exchanges/queues:

   | ------------------------------ |:--------:| --- |
   | `consumer-exchange`            | exchange | has to exist |
   | `consumer-queue--retry`        | exchange | fanout exchange |
   | `consumer-queue--backoff`      | exchange | fanout exchange |
   | `consumer-queue--dead-letters` | queue    | `x-dead-letter-exchange: <retry exchange>` |

   And the following bindings:

   | ------------------------------ | --- |
   | `consumer-queue`               | - `#` via `consumer-exchange`<br />- all from `consumer-queue--retry` (fanout) |
   | `consumer-queue--dead-letters` | all from `consumer-queue--backoff` (fanout) |

   __Behaviour__

   If a consumer NACKs or REJECTs a message with the `:requeue?` flag set
   (default on NACK), or message processing throws an exception, the message
   will be dead-lettered. This means:

   1. Publish the message to the backoff exchange, setting an \"expiration\"
      value. The message will be added to the dead-letter queue.
   2. Once the timeout expires, the message will be published to the retry
      exchange. Since a binding to this exchange was added to the original
      consumer queue, the message will reappear there.

   __Caveat__

   There is one caveat (also noted in the RabbitMQ documentation), consisting of
   expiry only happening at the head of the queue. This means that all messages
   in the dead letter queue will take at least the same time as the current head
   to be republished.
